          <p>
            It was incredibly exciting for me to land in Santiago. My first step
            onto Latin American soil (and frankly after 11 hours of flying; most
            places would look delightful!)
          </p>
          <p>
            Interesting that Australians have a friendship tax we need to pay at
            immigration :)
          </p>
          <p>Seeing a vast city without her people takes a moment to digest.</p>
          <p>
            But for the folks we did see; it was a joy to see people enjoying a
            slower pace of life and living life well - eating well, laughing a
            lot and most noticeably treating both their environ and their fellow
            citizens well.
          </p>
          <p>
            This sense of egalitarism and civic responsibility is the stand-out
            for me.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whether it was above ground views from that cable car ride, or
            proving to ourselves that we could party with the millenials until
            dawn; Santiago did not disappoint.
          </p>
          <p>
            The dangerous part of town (Pio Nono) as suggested by our Uber
            driver turned out to be people just eager to get you to dance; and
            that's ok in our books.
          </p>
          <h3 className={classes.title}>Fun Fact:</h3>

          <p>
            For a Latin American developing nation, my Australian dollars really
            DID NOT go far enough!
