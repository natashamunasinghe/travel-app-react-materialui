          <p>
            Navigating the Chilean roads from Santiago to Valparaiso in a manual
            car (more the car, than the roads), was in itself a treat. More for
            me, than you I think.
          </p>
          <p>
            Remember that lunch by the ocean before we hit Valparaiso? I still
            think wistfully about that piece of cake which escaped my lips.
          </p>
          <p>
            We walked in our room. Looked out into the horizon through those
            jumbo glass windows; and all we saw was beautiful blue ocean. I
            remember thinking
            <i>&quot;Damn, N%$%$%%$, you made a good choice&quot;.</i>
          </p>
          <p>Because frankly speaking, it could have gone either way.</p>

          <p>
            It really was the United Nations on that rooftop that glorious,
            moonlit night. I cannot remember anything but laughter. What magic a
            bunch of complete strangers can create. Doesn't that in itself give
            you hope?
          </p>
          <p>I am glad you enjoyed your birthday. You deserve nothing less.</p>
          <h3 className={classes.title}>Unanswered Question:</h3>

          <p>
            I still have my photo collage of receipts. Did the hire car company
            charge you for tolls?
